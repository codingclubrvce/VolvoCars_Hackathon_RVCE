# Volvo Asset Manager

## Project Overview

This project is a Flutter-based application for asset management, integrated with a backend built using Java Spring Boot with Hibernate. The backend provides various API services required by the Flutter app to function. The backend and database files are included in a zipped folder attached to this project.

## Prerequisites

### Flutter Application

- Android Studio (preferred IDE)
- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK

### Backend

- Eclipse IDE
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- MySQL Workbench

## Setting Up the Backend

1. *Unzip the Backend Folder*
    - Unzip the provided backend folder which includes the Java Spring Boot project and the MySQL database file.

2. *Import the Spring Boot Project into Eclipse IDE*
    - Open Eclipse IDE.
    - Go to File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects.
    - Select the unzipped backend project folder and click Finish.

3. *Set Up the Database*
    - Open MySQL Workbench.
    - Create a new database schema.
    - Import the provided SQL file into this schema.

4. *Configure Database Connection*
    - Open the application.properties file in the Spring Boot project.
    - Configure the database connection properties (username, password, database URL, etc.).
      properties
      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
      spring.datasource.username=root
      spring.datasource.password=YOUR_PASSWORD


5. *Run the Spring Boot Application*
    - Right-click the project in Eclipse IDE.
    - Select Run As > Spring Boot App.

## Setting Up the Flutter Application

1. *Clone the Flutter Project*
    - Clone or download the Flutter project repository to your local machine.

2. *Open the Project in Android Studio*
    - Open Android Studio.
    - Select Open an Existing Project.
    - Navigate to the cloned Flutter project folder and open it.

3. *Install Dependencies*
    - Open the terminal in Android Studio.
    - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
      sh
      flutter pub get


4. *Configure API Endpoints*
    - Open the Flutter project and navigate to the configuration file where the API endpoints are defined.
    - Update the base URL to point to the backend server running the Spring Boot application.

5. *Run the Flutter Application*
    - Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
    - Click the Run button in Android Studio.
